# Hi, I'm SiriRangsanTech 👋

Building software, exploring deep tech, and turning complex systems into practical tools.  
I enjoy backend engineering, automation, system design, and emerging fields like quantum computing and AI-driven infrastructure.

## About Me

I build systems that solve real problems — from backend APIs and automation pipelines to experimental research projects in quantum computing and OS design. I enjoy working across the stack, optimizing performance, and shipping features that feel clean, reliable, and maintainable.

- 🔭 Currently working on: **Quantum Tutorials Hub**, **automation tools**, and **system-level experiments**
- 🌱 Learning: distributed systems, observability, and quantum–classical hybrid workflows
- 👯 Open to collaborate on: developer tools, backend systems, automation, and open-source libraries
- 💬 Ask me about: backend architecture, CI/CD, Node.js, Python, TypeScript, and system design
- ⚡ Fun fact: I automate everything before I even start the real work

## How I Work

- I ship in small, iterative releases  
- I write tests for critical paths  
- I value clean architecture and maintainable code  
- I document APIs and workflows clearly  
- I automate repetitive tasks aggressively  

---

## What I Value

- Clear communication and fast feedback loops  
- Observability: logs, metrics, tracing  
- Simplicity over premature optimization  
- Strong developer experience
